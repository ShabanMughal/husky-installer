## Technical Questions

<Accordions type="single">
  <Accordion title="What Node.js version do I need?">
    Husky Installer requires Node.js version 18.0.0 or higher. Check your version with:
    
    ```bash
    node --version
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I customize the generated hooks?">
    Absolutely! After installation, you can edit the hook files in the `.husky` directory to add or remove checks. The files are simple shell scripts.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Will this slow down my commits?">
    The pre-commit hook runs checks before each commit, which adds some time. However, this ensures code quality and prevents issues from being committed. You can optimize performance by:
    
    - Using lint-staged to only check changed files
    - Removing unnecessary checks
    - Running tests in CI instead of pre-commit
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I skip hooks temporarily?">
    Yes, you can bypass hooks for a single commit using:
    
    ```bash
    git commit --no-verify -m "message"
    ```
    
    However, this should only be used in emergencies as it bypasses all quality checks.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does this work with TypeScript?">
    Yes! Husky Installer works perfectly with TypeScript projects. You can add type checking to your pre-commit hook:
    
    <DocsCodeBlock
      title=".husky/pre-commit"
      lang="bash"
      code={`#!/usr/bin/env sh
. "$(dirname -- "$0")/_/husky.sh"

npm run type-check
npm run lint
npm run format`}
    />
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Configuration Questions

<Accordions type="single">
  <Accordion title="How do I change the commit message format?">
    Edit the `.husky/commit-msg` file to modify the commit message validation. You can switch between conventional commits, emoji commits, or create your own custom format.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use both Prettier and ESLint?">
    Yes! They work together well. Prettier handles code formatting while ESLint handles code quality rules. Make sure to configure them properly to avoid conflicts.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I add more hooks?">
    You can add additional hooks by creating new files in the `.husky` directory. Common hooks include:
    
    - `pre-push` - Runs before pushing to remote
    - `post-merge` - Runs after merging branches
    - `post-checkout` - Runs after checking out a branch
    
    Example:
    
    <DocsCodeBlock
      title=".husky/pre-push"
      lang="bash"
      code={`#!/usr/bin/env sh
. "$(dirname -- "$0")/_/husky.sh"

npm run test
npm run build`}
    />
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I disable specific checks?">
    Yes! Edit the hook files in `.husky` and remove or comment out the checks you don't want. For example, to disable Prettier:
    
    <DocsCodeBlock
      title=".husky/pre-commit"
      lang="bash"
      code={`#!/usr/bin/env sh
. "$(dirname -- "$0")/_/husky.sh"

# npm run format  # Disabled
npm run lint`}
    />
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Troubleshooting Questions

<Accordions type="single">
  <Accordion title="Why aren't my hooks running?">
    Common reasons:
    
    1. **Hooks not executable** - Run `chmod +x .husky/*`
    2. **Git hooks path not set** - Run `git config core.hooksPath .husky`
    3. **Husky not installed** - Run `npm install husky --save-dev`
    4. **Not in a git repository** - Run `git init`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I'm getting Prettier/ESLint errors on commit">
    This is expected behavior! The hooks are preventing you from committing code that doesn't meet your quality standards. To fix:
    
    1. **Auto-fix issues:**
       ```bash
       npm run format
       npm run lint -- --fix
       ```
    
    2. **Review and fix manually** if auto-fix doesn't work
    
    3. **Adjust rules** in `.prettierrc` or `eslint.config.js` if they're too strict
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I uninstall Husky Installer?">
    Husky Installer is just a setup tool. After installation, you can uninstall it:
    
    ```bash
    npm uninstall -g husky-installer
    ```
    
    The hooks will continue to work because they're part of your project now. To remove hooks entirely:
    
    ```bash
    npm uninstall husky
    rm -rf .husky
    git config --unset core.hooksPath
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does this work on Windows?">
    Yes! Husky Installer works on Windows, macOS, and Linux. However, on Windows, you may need to use Git Bash or WSL for the best experience.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Best Practices

<Accordions type="single">
  <Accordion title="What should I include in pre-commit hooks?">
    Recommended checks for pre-commit:
    
    - ✅ Code formatting (Prettier)
    - ✅ Linting (ESLint)
    - ✅ Type checking (TypeScript)
    - ⚠️ Unit tests (only fast ones)
    - ❌ Integration tests (too slow, run in CI)
    - ❌ Build process (too slow, run in CI)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Should I commit the .husky directory?">
    Yes! The `.husky` directory should be committed to your repository so that all team members have the same hooks configured.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I share this setup with my team?">
    Once you've set up Husky Installer:
    
    1. Commit the `.husky` directory
    2. Commit configuration files (`.prettierrc`, `eslint.config.js`)
    3. Add a `prepare` script to `package.json`:
       ```json
       {
         "scripts": {
           "prepare": "husky"
         }
       }
       ```
    4. Team members just need to run `npm install` and hooks will be set up automatically
